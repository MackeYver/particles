# Particles
A testbed for multithreaded applications. Will be a particle system that is multithreaded and uses a geometry
shader for generating triangles.

## Disclaimer
- The code in this project should probably not be considered as a good example in any shape or form
- If you're looking for learning resources you probably should look elsewhere


## My goals
- Create a multithreaded application
- Use geometry shader to generate geometry
- Create a small, but cool, project that could be finished in a reasonable time frame


## Dev. log.
Development will be documented in txt files -- in order to keep it simple and to the point -- which will be saved in the notes directory.
